## What's here

### [abq-building-permits](./abq-building-permits):

A computer application to retrieve a [spreadsheet of building permits](http://data.cabq.gov/business/buildingpermits/MetaData.pdf) each Sunday made available by the city of [Albuquerque Planning Department](https://www.cabq.gov/planning). Data in the spreadsheet is entered by planning department staff and via an online permit application system. It is the basis of [weekly story](https://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/search/results?q=%22building%20permits%22
) by [Albuquerque Business First](https://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque) Managing Editor [Chris Keller](https://www.bizjournals.com/albuquerque/bio/41347/Chris%20Keller), who reviews the data before it is published.
