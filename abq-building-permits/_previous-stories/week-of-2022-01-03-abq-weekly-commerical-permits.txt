This story was automatically generated by a computer application and is based on public records made available by the city of Albuquerque Planning Department. The application retrieves a spreadsheet of building permits each Sunday. Data in the spreadsheet is entered by planning department staff and via an online permit application system. Albuquerque Business First Managing Editor Chris Keller reviews the data before it is published. Estimated cost is calculated by the building department and is based on a formula that takes into account the square footage of the project, labor costs and materials. During the week of Aug. 17, 2020, a change in the available data removed details about the type of work being done. That change is reflected here.
