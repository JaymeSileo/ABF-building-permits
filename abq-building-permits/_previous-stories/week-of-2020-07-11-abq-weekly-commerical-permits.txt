The application retrieves a spreadsheet of building permits each Sunday. Data in the spreadsheet is entered by planning department staff and via an online permit application system. Albuquerque Business First Managing Editor Chris Keller reviews the data before it is published. Estimated cost is calculated by the building department and is based on a formula that takes into account the square footage of the project, labor costs and materials.
